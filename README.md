Day 3: 50-Day LeetCode Milestone Challenge

Hey connections,

Today, I tackled two interesting problems:

 Problem 1: Rotate Image (Q48)
- Problem Statement: Given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Approach:
  - Transpose and Reverse: First, I transposed the matrix (swap rows with columns), then reversed each row to achieve the 90-degree rotation.

Problem 2: Key Pair (GeeksforGeeks)
- Problem Statement: Given an array Arr of N positive integers and another number X. Determine whether or not there exist two elements in Arr whose sum is exactly X.
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Approach:
  - Two-Pointer Approach: I sorted the array and used two pointers to find the pair with the given sum.


Stay tuned for daily updates as I continue this exciting challenge!
